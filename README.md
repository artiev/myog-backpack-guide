A guide to building your own backpack
-------------------------------------

There is a growing trend in building outdoor gear: make it lighter.
And there is a will amongst trekkers and hikers alike to focus more on
the essentials than 'hoarding' half of your home on the trail.

This document here presented is a personal take on how I build my lightweight
backpacks. The following picture shows one of my self-made packs.

In this essay, I will go through the complete process I follow to build packs,
and include a number of chapters covering (but not limited to):

- What features I consider when designing a pack.
- Choice of lighter fabrics and which materials I prefer.
- Different building methods and different designs I came up with.
- Complete documentation of a finished packs from design to execution.
- Where I find inspiration.
- How I work on these packs (workspace, tools, etc...)

If you are not familiar with any of this, then have a look
inside. If you are, and you are interested in looking at how I make my backpacks
from the sketches and designs to execution and example photos, read on!

Feel free to read, share, love, hate, but most of all, comment, review, raise
questions and concerns so I can make it better.
