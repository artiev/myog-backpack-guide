A guide to building your own backpack
-------------------------------------

There is a growing trend in building outdoor gear: make it lighter.
And there is a will amongst trekkers and hikers alike to focus more on
the essentials than 'hoarding' half of your home on the trail.

This document here presented is a personal take on how I build my lightweight
backpacks.

I highlight how I am using lighter fabrics, and go on to document different
building methods and different designs to achieve a consequent weight loss of
my base weight. If you are not familiar with any of this, then have a look
inside. If you are, and you are interested in looking at how I make my backpacks
from the sketches and designs to execution and example photos, read on!

Feel free to read, share, love, hate, but most of all, comment, review, raise
questions and concerns so I can make it better.
