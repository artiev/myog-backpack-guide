If there is one thing that is important to any kind of creative process, it is space. I just wanted to document my project table, to show you that the bare essentials you need are not that many. Sure, having a better working space - bigger, better organised, with more stuff - would be nice, but I have all I need right here.

\section{Different needs, different spaces}
\input{chapters/workspace/spaces}

\section{Research and drawing space}
\input{chapters/workspace/space-drawing}

\section{Sewing workspace}
\input{chapters/workspace/space-sewing}
