In most cases, the coarse design of my backpacks is a basic rectangular prism. The dimensions however, are not that easy to figure out, and depend on the target volume as well as how I wear a pack, my torso length and my shoulder width. I also consider aesthetics as a factor, and try wherever possible to stick to pleasing forms and harmonious dimensions. For the latter, I often refer to the \textit{golden ratio} (see \ref{sec:golden-ratio}) which has been used across the ages for bringing mathematical harmony to art, architecture, and many other applications.
