There is a backpack for any situation, and it's always interesting to look at what others are doing. I have a few backpacks - both commercial and custom made - at home I can analyse inside and out to figure out what I'm interested in. And there is a plethora of detailed pictures and designs on the web, ranging from home made MYOG articles, to high-end ultralight gear manufacturer, to cost-effective mass production design.
