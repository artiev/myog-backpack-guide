Any self-respecting fabrics retailer will offer sample sets. Use them! I cannot stress that enough! There is no amount of research in the world that will give you a feel for a fabric. But a few bucks spent on acquiring a complete set of samples for what you need will. Have a look at the illustration \ref{img:fabrics-sample-sets} to know what I mean by that.
