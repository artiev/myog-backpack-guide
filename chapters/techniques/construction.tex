\subsection{Account for the seams before you cut}\label{sec:seams-and-cutouts}

In most of the drawings in this documentI only highlight the basic dimensions of the finished panels and add a symbolic outer seam allowance.

Before cutting any panels for a backpack, you should pay attention to all the seams and extra fabric necessary to bind and build all the features of each panel.

The illustration \ref{ske:panel-back-seam-highlight} is an example of how seams can impact fabric cut-out of the panel shown in illustration \ref{ske:panel-back-design}, and why you should always have a few drawing of the features of your pack. In this instance, I would cut 4 separate panels and assemble them into a complete back panel before starting working on another panel.

\begin{note}
  When working on design which involve multiple parts per panel, you also want to consider the fabric's patterns, and make sure they match!
\end{note}
