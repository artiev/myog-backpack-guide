First things first, when reading the following chapter, keep one thing in mind: I do my best to design lightweight backpacks, but I wouldn't push it so far as to calling them ultralight packs. There are highly specialised, very talented backpack makers out there who focus all their attention on ultralight hikers (and thru-hikers),  and they come up with amazing featherweight designs. Personally, I have a less drastic approach to weight loss in general, but I am still aiming at a substantial weight reduction without hampering the functionality of my packs.
