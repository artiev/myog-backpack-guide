There is something about making my own outdoor gear that I can't get enough of. I have always been a maker to some extent, and - usually - my creations are very short lived. I've come to think of it as being more about the process, about the work I put into making something, and the learnings I get from it, rather than about the outcome itself.

For outdoor gear, it is still about the process, but the outcome is tangible to a much grater extent than anything else, as I can use it, abuse it, and improve upon every iteration. Take the example of backpacks: I can carefully plan every part of it, dedicate every feature to a particular problem I want to solve in a particular situation, and do tons of research, but then, I end up with something more than the sum of my work, something I'm going to enjoy (or hate) for miles to come, literally.
